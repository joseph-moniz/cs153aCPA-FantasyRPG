  This app is designed to be a miniature dungeon RPG with a fantasy theme. At
its core, the app is a sword-and-sorcery turn-based RPG. Currently, the player
can choose their first character from a variety of options, and this character's
information is stored asynchronously. The turn-based combat system will be the
major component of the app. During a player's turn, the player can select from
different actions: attacking, using items, and running away. The combat system
should have a handler component that handles the battle on-screen, diverse
enemies, an established turn order, damage calculations, status effects, and
loot rewards. The player's characters should also gain experience.

Dev notes: standard React Native / JavaScript. FlatList, TouchableOpacity,
and ScrollView from React native. AsyncStorage from
@react-native-async-storage/async-storage. NavigationContainer and
createNativeStackNavigator from React Navigation.
